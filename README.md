# Django with GeoLocation
# INTRODUCTION
During this pandemic situation of COVID 19 establishing of quarantine centers for the 
treatment of disease has been proved really beneficial.
Selection for appropriate destinations for these centers has a huge impact on helping the 
victims or those who face an emergency situation. Using the Geospatial Information 
system(GIS) along with the metaheuristic algorithm of pso (particle swarm optimization) and 
Ant colony optimization can be used for proper center location Identification and resource 
allocation.
Resources are distributed non uniformly depending on the requirement. Considering an 
example, the quantity of beds required in urban areas would differ from the requirement of 
the same in rural areas.
It would depend on various factors such as availability of population in nearby areas, 
availability of hospitals nearby, commuting facility. This makes resource and locationallocation a complex optimization problem.
There are various causes of complexity. One of them can be counted upon as the total 
distance of the centers from the allocated area of the patient[1].
The other one can be counted upon as the scope of search space. If we take into consideration 
the number of option in regard to the location to be selected the scope of search is huge[1]. 
Using mathematical and direct computation in this scenario is really very time consuming [1] 
If in this case, we consider using meta-heuristic methods for generating appropriate solutions, 
it can be of great help and help in finding an optimum solution in a reasonable time[2]
The main aim is to apply PSO ACO and various other MCDM techniques for allocating 
appropriate locations for COVID quarantine centers. For this, we would be using The 
TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution ), GIS, and other 
decision-making techniques using clustering methods. The fundamental purpose behind this 
is to diminish the search scope to a set limited number of sites. At that point, the last centers 
are chosen and bundles are dispensed to them utilizing PSO and ACO meta-heuristic 
calculations

The objective is to demonstrate our findings in the form of a django website
